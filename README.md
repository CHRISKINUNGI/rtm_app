## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with the following layers:

### Presentation Layer
- **Views**: UI components and screens
- **Controllers**: State management using GetX
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components

### Domain Layer
- **Models**: Data models for visits, customers, and activities
- **Services**: Business logic and data operations

### Data Layer
- **API Services**: Communication with Supabase backend
- **Offline Storage**: Local data persistence using SharedPreferences
- **Sync Service**: Handles data synchronization between local and remote

## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Visit Management**
   - Create new visits
   - View visit history
   - Track visit status
   - Add visit notes and location

2. **Activity Tracking**
   - Record activities during visits
   - View activity history
   - Track completion status

3. **Offline Support**
   - Create visits offline
   - Automatic sync when online
   - Conflict resolution
   - Network status monitoring

4. **Search and Filtering**
   - Search by customer name
   - Filter by date range
   - Filter by status
   - Filter by activities

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**
